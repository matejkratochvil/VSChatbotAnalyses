- **Budget:** Claude 3 Haiku (65% benchmark) - $0.25/$1.25 per 1M tokens

## F) Technical Considerations

### Long-Term Memory Implementation
**Architecture:** Multi-layer memory system
- **Short-term:** Last 5-10 exchanges in context window
- **Episodic:** Past conversation history with semantic retrieval
- **Semantic:** User profile (interests, grades, preferences) with progressive enhancement
- **Procedural:** Response templates and workflows

**Storage:** PostgreSQL for structured data, LangGraph MemorySaver for cross-session persistence, Redis for active session state.

### Database Integration for \u003c2s Responses
**Optimization strategies:**
- Composite indexes on user_id, session_id, timestamp
- pgvector with HNSW index for similarity search (\u003c100ms)
- PgBouncer connection pooling (100-200 connections)
- Query targets: 95th percentile \u003c100ms
- Redis caching for frequent queries

**Response Time Budget:**
- Database: 100-200ms
- LLM API: 1,000-1,500ms
- Application logic: 50-100ms
- Network: 50-100ms
- **Total: 1,200-1,900ms (under 2s target)**

### Prompt Caching
**OpenAI:** Automatic caching, 50% discount, 1,024 token minimum, 5-10 min TTL
**Anthropic:** Manual cache_control, 90% discount on hits, break-even at 2-3 requests
**Expected savings:** 50-90% on repeated context (system prompts, RAG context, user profiles)

### Guardrails to Prevent Misuse
**Multi-layer approach:**
1. **Input guardrails:** Topic classification, prompt injection detection, PII filtering
2. **System prompt reinforcement:** Strict role definition, refusal templates
3. **Output validation:** Response relevance checking, hallucination detection
4. **Usage limits:** Max 5 sessions/day, 20 messages/session, 10 messages/minute
5. **Monitoring:** Track guardrail triggers, identify abuse patterns

**Implementation:** NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails or Azure Content Safety for production-grade filtering

### Czech/Slovak Language Handling
**Detection:** Azure Text Analytics API with 80%+ confidence threshold
**Welcome messages:** Bilingual greeting, then adapt to detected language
**System prompts:** Language-specific with correct terminology (bakalář vs. bakalár)
**Handling switches:** Detect mid-conversation language changes, acknowledge and adapt

### GA4 Analytics Integration
**Core events:**
- Session lifecycle: started, ended
- Messages: sent, received (with intent, tokens, response time)
- Business: program viewed, universities compared, application info requested
- Feedback: positive/negative ratings, CSAT scores
- Technical: errors, guardrail triggers, cache hits

**Custom dimensions:** session_id, user_language, intent, response_time_ms, tokens_used, cache_hit, model_used

**Monitoring dashboards:** Response time by intent, cache hit rates, cost per session, conversation funnels, user satisfaction trends

### Scenario Processing
**Three career counselor personas:**
1. **Exploratory:** Open-ended discovery, broad questioning (350 tokens system prompt)
2. **Analytical:** Data-driven matching, algorithm-based recommendations (400 tokens)
3. **Supportive:** Encouragement-focused, emotional support (350 tokens)

**Routing logic:** Detect user needs from first 2-3 exchanges, switch scenarios based on conversation flow

### Web Search Integration
**Conditional routing:**
- Check knowledge base first (PostgreSQL + Azure AI Search)
- Trigger web search only when: information not in DB, currency required, user explicitly requests external source
- Cost-benefit: 1 search per 3 sessions optimal

**Decision logic:** Hybrid RAG + web search with synthesis prompt combining both sources
